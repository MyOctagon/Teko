# Alphabets
Teko uses both Abugaidas and Segmental Writing Systems. The uses depend on the personal preference of the writer (Currently).
Abugaidas is known as Kaliri System (<teko>delemo</teko>) and Segmental Writing is known as Delemo System in Teko.
If you don't know what these means then just use Delemo, it's the one English uses.

> Due to technical problems, this documentation currently uses Delemo System.

We usually use Delemo in computers and Kaliri in handwriting.
