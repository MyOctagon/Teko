# Alphabets
Teko uses both Abugaidas and Segmental Writing Systems. The uses depend on the personal preference of the writer (Currently).
Abugaidas is known as Kaliri System and Segmental Writing is known as Delemo System in Teko.
If you don't know what these means then just use Delemo, it's the one English uses.

> Due to technical problems, this documentation currently uses Delemo System.

We usually use Delemo in computers and Kaliri in handwriting.
