# Teko Language
This is an Open Source language !!!!

This is a language made by Octagon. It can be called as a conlang. All the letters, sounds and grammers of this language can be viewed in this repo. This language is still under development so major changes can be done in the rules.

Teko is not a decentralized language like other languages like English rater it is a centralized language. Meaning, Teko's changes are recorded on the other hand other languages are changed overtime but no one know how it changed or when it changed.
But Teko uses this repo as the base. So the language is not going to change until this repo gets updated. Which means Teko's changes are not anonymous like any other languages. But that doesn't mean that no one other than me can make changes to the language.
Any one can make pull requests to this language and if they are good then they will be added to the language. So anyone can contribute by adding, removing or changing words, grammars or any other things.

The advantages of this method of language development is that the changes are recorded and so a research on the language evolution is not necessary as the changes will be recorded on each change and the language can be developed quickly as the changes will not
take long time to be widespread. As anyone can see the central rule set anytime to know about the changes. This can also help in education as the wrong grammar usage or the use of meaningless words can be easily identified while cheking exam scripts.
